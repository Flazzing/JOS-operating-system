1. The reason why we want to have individual handler function for each exception/interupt is because we want to be able to better enforce kernel mode protection. In short, we want to be able to better provide protection when handling error. 

2. No we dont have to do anything to make the user/softint program behave correctly. The reason why it should produce trap 13 is because int $14 produces general protection fault "T_GPFLT".
